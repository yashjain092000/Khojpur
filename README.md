-A lost found things management app.

## Motivation
During lockdown period I was taking to my friend, who told me that he was unable to fill an internship form and lost a good opportunity as he had lost his college ID card at the campus which he needed to upload in the form. As we were pondering upon the situation, I came across a solution of providing an automated lost-found things management system which will inform everyone about all the lost, found things (if any) and also the genuine claimer can easily claim it from the concerned person. Also, with this system you may easily claim it from the concerned person by providing him the right details.

### Problem Statement
To develop a mobile application that will be quite helpful in solving the problem of finding the lost things and also to identify the genuine claimer for the same. With the use of this application everyone associated with the campus will always be updated regarding any lost or found item and also if it is claimed or not.
This application will not only ease the task for the concerned person or the department to run it but also help them maintain the record of all items digitally without any manual entry system.

#### About this application
Every college, society or a campus is vast in terms of area as well as number of people existing there. With people, comes their things and belongings and as it is said ‘you are yourself responsible for your belongings’, but what if you found something which would mean nothing to you but for someone it could be their life’s work or something quite valuable.
All campuses have departments for various tasks and concerns but most of them lack the lost-found things department or if it’s there it actually doesn’t work out the solution of the problem due the usual traditional way they follow. Also, there is no concerned person or a specified path for such a problem and to inform everyone regarding the same in most of the colleges and campuses.
So, it is required to develop a system that will manage all the information related to a thing or belonging lost or found by anyone, it’s claim by genuine person and make the process hassle-free and less-time taking for both the person who has lost and who has found it. The system should have the ability to display the sufficient information (not all the details) regarding lost or found things and the genuine claimer could easily collect his/her belongings. Also, the system should keep track and a record of all the lost, found and claimed things encountered till date thereby eliminating and digitalising the traditional manual entry system.

##### Objectives of the Project
• To develop a system that could solve the problem of lost and found things at a campus.
• To make the whole process of uploading the information and sharing it to all automated, easy, less time consuming and hassle-free.
• To display only relevant information regarding a lost thing so that only the actual owner can claim it.
• To ease the process for the concerned person so that he may handle the claiming process genuinely and smoothly.
• To keep a record of all the lost, found and claimed things till present date.
